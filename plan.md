### **Blumio MVP: Task Management & Team Collaboration Platform**

**Tagline**: _"Blumio brings all your tasks, teams & tools together"_

**Objective**: The goal of the MVP is to create a lightweight but fully functional platform for task management and collaboration that serves software professionals, enabling them to manage projects, collaborate with team members, and schedule tasks more efficiently.

### **Key Features for MVP**

1. **Task Management**

   - **Create Tasks**: Users can create tasks by specifying a title, description, due date, priority (low, medium, high), and associated tags (e.g., “urgent,” “feature,” “bug”).
   - **Task Assignment**: Users can assign tasks to specific team members. Each team member will receive a notification when they are assigned a new task.
   - **Task Status**: Tasks will have customizable statuses such as “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Completed.”
   - **Task Prioritization**: Tasks can be prioritized to make it clear which are most urgent.
   - **Task Filtering**: Users can filter tasks based on priority, due date, or status, helping them focus on what matters most.

2. **Time Slots/Scheduling**

   - **Calendar Integration**: Sync tasks with Google Calendar or a built-in calendar to automatically set deadlines and manage time slots.
   - **Time Tracking**: Each task will allow users to track the time spent working on it, showing the time used versus the time estimated.
   - **Reminders**: Automated reminders for upcoming tasks and deadlines sent via email or notifications within the app.

3. **Team Collaboration**

   - **Real-time Updates**: As users update tasks, the app will instantly reflect changes to all team members (via websockets or a polling system).
   - **Team Chat/Comments**: Team members can comment on tasks, allowing for feedback and progress discussions. Chatrooms or group chats can be created for teams working on specific projects.
   - **Activity Feed**: A feed that tracks all activity (new tasks, task updates, new comments) for transparency and to keep everyone informed.
   - **File Sharing**: Attach files to tasks to centralize information. This could include project documentation, mockups, code snippets, etc.

4. **User Onboarding**

   - **Account Creation**: Users can sign up with email/password or through a third-party authentication provider (Google, GitHub).
   - **Onboarding Tutorial**: A step-by-step guide for new users to familiarize themselves with how to create tasks, assign them, and use the key features of the platform.
   - **User Profiles**: Team members will have personal profiles that display their name, role, and assigned tasks.

### **Target Audience**

- **Primary Audience**: Software professionals such as developers, engineers, architects, and designers. These users often work in teams and need a tool to manage tasks efficiently and collaborate.
- **Secondary Audience**: Project managers who oversee multiple teams and need to ensure tasks are completed on time.

### **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**:

  - **React 18**: A robust JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. React will allow efficient re-renders of the app with its component-based architecture.
  - **Vite**: A fast development environment for React, providing instant hot-reloading and optimized builds.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework to quickly build custom designs without writing custom CSS. It will help in maintaining a consistent UI and ensure responsiveness.
  - **React Icons**: For including vector icons, ensuring that the UI remains clean and intuitive.

- **Backend** (for MVP, a basic Node.js backend could be used):

  - **Express.js**: A minimal web framework for Node.js, ideal for building the API that handles tasks, user management, notifications, etc.
  - **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL) for storing tasks, user information, and real-time data. Alternatively, a simple SQL database like PostgreSQL can be used depending on the need for complex querying.
  - **Real-Time Collaboration**: WebSockets will be implemented to allow real-time communication, ensuring instant updates and collaboration features like messaging and task updates.

### **User Flow**

1. **Landing Page**: The first page that users will see is a clean, simple landing page with the tagline: _"Blumio brings all your tasks, teams & tools together."_ It will include a "Get Started" button that directs users to the sign-up or login page.

2. **Dashboard**: Once logged in, the user is taken to a dashboard where they can:

   - View all tasks assigned to them.
   - See tasks filtered by their status (To Do, In Progress, Completed).
   - Access a calendar view of upcoming tasks and deadlines.
   - See an activity feed of all updates happening within the team.

3. **Task Creation**: From the dashboard, users can click on “Create Task” and enter details like task name, description, assignee, due date, and priority.

4. **Task Assignment and Collaboration**:

   - A team member receives a notification when assigned a task.
   - Once the task is opened, they can add comments, share files, and update the task status.
   - The team can collaborate through comments under the task, allowing for discussion.

5. **Task Filtering & Scheduling**: Users can filter tasks by priority or due date. They can also view a calendar of their tasks, drag and drop tasks to different days, and set reminders.

6. **Notifications**: Users receive email notifications or in-app notifications when:

   - They are assigned a new task.
   - A task assigned to them is updated.
   - There are comments or discussions about their tasks.

7. **Onboarding & Profile Setup**: New users are guided through an onboarding process where they set up their profile, connect with their team, and learn how to create tasks and collaborate effectively.

### **What the MVP Contains**

1. **Core features for task management**: Task creation, task assignment, prioritization, status updates, and filtering.
2. **Scheduling**: Basic calendar integration and task scheduling with due dates and reminders.
3. **Team Collaboration**: Comments, real-time updates, and file sharing.
4. **User Onboarding**: Simple sign-up, onboarding tutorial, and user profile management.
5. **Responsive UI**: Tailwind CSS ensures the platform is mobile-friendly, especially for busy professionals on the go.
6. **Minimal Backend**: A basic Express.js API that manages user tasks, user authentication, and interactions.
